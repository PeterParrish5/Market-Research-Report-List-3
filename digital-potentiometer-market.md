<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Digital Potentiometer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Volatile</li><li>Volatile</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Digital potentiometers are electronic devices that can dynamically adjust resistance values in a circuit. The market for digital potentiometers can be categorized into two types: non-volatile and volatile. Non-volatile digital potentiometers retain their resistance settings even after power is turned off, making them suitable for applications where values need to be stored and recalled. Volatile digital potentiometers, on the other hand, reset their resistance values to a default setting every time power is turned off. They are commonly used in applications where resistance adjustments are required to be made each time the device is powered on.</p></p>
