<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Percutaneous Nephroscope Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rigid</li><li>Flexible</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The percutaneous nephroscope market comprises two types: rigid and flexible nephroscopes. Rigid nephroscopes are inflexible devices used for rigid endoscopy procedures, offering better visualization due to their larger diameter. They are commonly used for treating larger stones or performing surgical interventions. In contrast, flexible nephroscopes have a smaller diameter and can navigate through narrow and tortuous anatomical structures. They are preferred for procedures where the target area is challenging to access, providing increased flexibility and reduced patient discomfort. Rigid and flexible nephroscopes cater to different clinical needs within the percutaneous nephroscope market.</p></p>
