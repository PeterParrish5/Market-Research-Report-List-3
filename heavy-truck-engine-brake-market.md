<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heavy Truck Engine Brake Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Compression Release Brake</li><li>Exhaust Brake</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Compression release brakes work by creating back pressure in the engine cylinders, which slows down the vehicle by reducing the power of the engine. This type of brake is commonly used in heavy trucks and provides effective braking power. Exhaust brakes, on the other hand, work by restricting the flow of exhaust gases, which creates resistance and slows down the vehicle. Both types of brakes are commonly used in heavy trucks to assist with braking on steep inclines or during heavy loads.</p></p>
