<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anticoagulant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Oral</li><li>Injectable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Anticoagulants are medications used to prevent blood clotting. There are two main types of anticoagulant markets: oral and injectable. Oral anticoagulants, such as Warfarin, are taken in pill form and work by interfering with the production of clotting factors in the liver. Injectable anticoagulants, like Heparin or Enoxaparin, are administered via injection and work by directly inhibiting clotting factors in the blood. Both types are used to reduce the risk of blood clots and are prescribed based on the individual's medical condition and preference.</p></p>
