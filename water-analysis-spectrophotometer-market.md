<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Water Analysis Spectrophotometer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Beam</li><li>Double Beam</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Water Analysis Spectrophotometer Market offers two primary types of spectrophotometers: Single Beam and Double Beam. Single Beam spectrophotometers use a single cuvette to measure light absorption by a sample, making them cost-effective and simple to use. However, they require recalibration frequently to maintain accuracy. On the other hand, Double Beam spectrophotometers use two cuvettes, one for the sample and one as a reference, allowing for simultaneous measurement, enhanced accuracy, and minimization of errors caused by fluctuations in light intensity.</p></p>
