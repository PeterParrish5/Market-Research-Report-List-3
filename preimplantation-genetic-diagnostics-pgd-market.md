<p><p>Preimplantation Genetic Diagnostics (PGD) is a reproductive technology used during in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles to screen embryos for genetic disorders before implantation. It involves the removal of one or two cells from an embryo, which are then tested for abnormalities or genetic diseases such as cystic fibrosis, Down syndrome, or sickle cell anemia. PGD helps in selecting the embryos that are free from genetic disorders, reducing the risk of passing on genetic diseases to the child.</p><p>The global Preimplantation Genetic Diagnostics (PGD) market is expected to witness substantial growth during the forecast period. The increasing awareness about genetic disorders and the rising demand for healthy babies have propelled the market growth. Advancements in genetic testing technologies and the growing availability of genetic testing centers have further contributed to this growth.</p><p>Moreover, the increasing prevalence of genetic disorders, the rising number of IVF procedures, and the growing trend of delaying parenthood are likely to drive the demand for PGD. Additionally, government initiatives promoting genetic testing and the widespread adoption of IVF techniques in developed countries are expected to fuel market growth.</p><p>The market is also witnessing several technological advancements and innovations. For instance, the introduction of next-generation sequencing (NGS) has improved the accuracy and efficiency of PGD. NGS enables the simultaneous screening of multiple genetic disorders in embryos, providing more comprehensive results.</p><p>In conclusion, the Preimplantation Genetic Diagnostics (PGD) market is anticipated to experience significant growth at a CAGR of 7.4% during the forecast period. Factors such as increasing awareness about genetic disorders, advancements in genetic testing technologies, and government initiatives promoting genetic testing are expected to drive market growth.
