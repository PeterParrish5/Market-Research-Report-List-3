<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polyurethane Cutting Machines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CNC</li><li>Manually-controlled</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Polyurethane cutting machines can be classified into two main types: CNC (Computer Numerical Control) and manually-controlled machines. CNC machines are operated by computerized programs that precisely control the cutting process, offering high accuracy and efficiency. On the other hand, manually-controlled machines are operated by human operators, who adjust and control the cutting process manually. While CNC machines are preferred for large-scale production due to their automation and precision, manually-controlled machines are typically used for smaller scale projects that require more flexibility and customization.</p></p>
