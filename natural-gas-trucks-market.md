<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Natural Gas Trucks Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CNG Trucks</li><li>LNG Trucks</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Natural gas trucks market consists of two main types: CNG trucks and LNG trucks. Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) trucks use gas that is compressed and stored at high pressure, making them suitable for shorter distances and urban delivery routes. On the other hand, Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) trucks use gas that has been cooled and condensed into a liquid, allowing for longer ranges and over-the-road hauling. Both types of trucks offer environmental benefits and cost savings compared to traditional diesel trucks.</p></p>
