<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Variable Conductance Heat Pipes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wicked with Cold Reservoir</li><li>Wickless with Hot Reservoir</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Variable Conductance Heat Pipes have two main market types: Wicked with Cold Reservoir and Wickless with Hot Reservoir. Wicked with Cold Reservoir heat pipes have a wick structure that helps to transport vapor from the cold reservoir to the hot reservoir, allowing for efficient heat transfer. On the other hand, Wickless with Hot Reservoir heat pipes operate without a wick, relying on thermomagnetic pumping or capillary action to transport vapor to the heat sink. Each market type caters to different applications and temperature ranges.</p></p>
