<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Galvanized Strand Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electro Galvanized Strand</li><li>Hot-Dip Galvanized Strand</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Galvanized strand is a metal wire that has been coated with a layer of zinc to protect it from corrosion. There are two main types of galvanized strand: electro galvanized strand and hot-dip galvanized strand. Electro galvanized strand is coated with zinc through an electrolytic process, while hot-dip galvanized strand is coated by dipping the wire into molten zinc. Both types provide excellent corrosion resistance, with the hot-dip galvanized strand offering a thicker and more durable coating compared to the electro galvanized strand.</p></p>
