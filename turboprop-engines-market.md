<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Turboprop Engines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Axial-Flow Type Turboprop Engines</li><li>Centrifugal Type Turboprop Engines</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Turboprop engines are commonly categorized into two main types: axial-flow and centrifugal. Axial-flow turboprop engines have a design where the airflow is parallel to the axis of the engine, allowing for efficient thrust generation. On the other hand, centrifugal turboprop engines have a design where the airflow is perpendicular to the axis, resulting in a simpler and more compact structure. Both types have their own advantages and are chosen based on factors such as efficiency, size, and specific application requirements.</p></p>
