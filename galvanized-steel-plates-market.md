<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Galvanized Steel Plates Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>HotRolled</li><li>ColdRolled</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Galvanized steel plates are classified based on the method used for shaping the steel into plates. Hot-rolled plates are formed by heating the steel at high temperatures, making them more malleable and easier to shape. Cold-rolled plates, on the other hand, are formed by cooling the steel at room temperature, resulting in a smoother surface finish and tighter tolerances. Both types of plates are then coated with a layer of zinc to prevent corrosion, making them ideal for various industrial applications.</p></p>
