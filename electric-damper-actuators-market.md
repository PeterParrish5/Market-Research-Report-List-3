<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electric Damper Actuators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Spring Return Damper Actuators</li><li>Non-Spring Return Damper Actuators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Electric damper actuators can be categorized into two main types: Spring Return Damper Actuators and Non-Spring Return Damper Actuators. Spring Return Damper Actuators are designed to automatically return to their default position when power is lost, providing fail-safe functionality. On the other hand, Non-Spring Return Damper Actuators do not rely on a spring mechanism and instead use electric power to control the damper position. Both types offer precise control over airflow in HVAC systems, catering to different operational requirements and preferences.</p></p>
