<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Disposable Hemodialyzer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>High-Flux Dialyzer</li><li>Low-Flux Dialyzer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The disposable hemodialyzer market is divided into two main types: high-flux dialyzers and low-flux dialyzers. High-flux dialyzers are designed with larger pores to allow for better removal of waste products and toxins from the blood during hemodialysis treatments. They are typically recommended for patients with more advanced kidney disease. On the other hand, low-flux dialyzers have smaller pores and are used for patients with less severe kidney dysfunction. They provide a slower and gentler filtering process. Both types of dialyzers are disposable and widely used in hemodialysis treatments.</p></p>
