<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bus Starter & Alternator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Alternator</li><li>Starter Motor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The bus starter and alternator market includes two main types of components: alternators and starter motors. Alternators are responsible for converting mechanical energy into electrical energy to charge the bus's battery and power its electrical systems. Starter motors, on the other hand, are used to start the engine by cranking it until it reaches a speed where it can run on its own. Both alternators and starter motors are essential for the proper functioning of a bus's electrical and engine systems.</p></p>
