<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Folklift Solid Tire Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cured-on Solid Tire</li><li>Pressed-on Solid Tire</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Forklift solid tires can be categorized into two main types: cured-on solid tires and pressed-on solid tires. Cured-on solid tires are manufactured using a vulcanization process that chemically bonds the rubber to the tire's steel rim. This ensures a strong and durable connection between the tire and rim. On the other hand, pressed-on solid tires are installed by pressing them onto the rim, without any chemical bonding. They rely on a tight fit and pressure to keep the tire in place. Both types are used in the forklift solid tire market, offering different benefits and suitability for various applications.</p></p>
