<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CBCT Dental Imaging Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Flat Panel Detectors</li><li>Image Intensifier</li></ul></p>
<p><p>CBCT Dental Imaging Market Types - Flat Panel Detectors and Image Intensifier:</p><p>Flat Panel Detectors (FPDs) are modern imaging devices used in CBCT dental imaging. They offer high-resolution images with reduced radiation exposure. FPDs use a direct conversion method which allows for fast and accurate image capturing. On the other hand, Image Intensifiers are older technology still used in some CBCT systems. They work by converting X-rays into visible light, which is then intensified and detected. However, Image Intensifiers have lower spatial resolution and are more susceptible to distortion compared to FPDs.</p></p>
