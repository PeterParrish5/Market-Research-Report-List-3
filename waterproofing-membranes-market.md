<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Waterproofing Membranes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sheet Based Membranes</li><li>Liquid Applied Membranes</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Waterproofing membranes are essential for protecting buildings from water damage. Sheet based membranes are pre-formed sheets made from materials like bitumen or synthetic rubber, providing a physical barrier against water. Liquid applied membranes are liquid materials that are applied on site, forming a seamless barrier that conforms to the shape of the substrate. Both types offer different strengths and weaknesses, with sheet membranes being easier to install but liquid membranes being more versatile in terms of application methods. Overall, both types play a crucial role in ensuring structures remain watertight.</p></p>
