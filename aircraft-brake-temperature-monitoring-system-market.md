<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aircraft Brake Temperature Monitoring System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-contact</li><li>Contact</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Aircraft brake temperature monitoring systems can be categorized into two types: non-contact and contact. Non-contact systems use infrared sensors to measure the temperature of the brake system without physically touching it, providing a safe and efficient way to monitor temperature from a distance. On the other hand, contact systems involve directly placing temperature sensors on the brake components to provide accurate readings but may require more maintenance. Both types offer unique benefits and are used in aircraft maintenance and safety procedures.</p></p>
