<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CPAP Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fixed Pressure CPAP Device</li><li>Auto Adjusting CPAP Device</li></ul></p>
<p><p>CPAP systems are respiratory devices used to treat sleep apnea. Fixed pressure CPAP devices deliver a constant airflow pressure to maintain an open airway during sleep. These devices are set at a fixed pressure level determined by a sleep specialist. On the other hand, auto-adjusting CPAP devices automatically monitor the patient's breathing and adjust the airflow pressure accordingly throughout the night. These systems are capable of responding to changes in breathing patterns, providing customized therapy based on the individual's needs. Both types aim to alleviate the symptoms of sleep apnea and improve overall sleep quality.</p></p>
