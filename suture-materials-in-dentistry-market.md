<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Suture Materials in Dentistry Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable Sutures</li><li>Non-absorbable Sutures</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Suture materials in dentistry can be classified into two main types: absorbable sutures and non-absorbable sutures. Absorbable sutures are made from materials that naturally break down in the body over time, eliminating the need for removal. They are commonly used for soft tissue healing in dental surgery. Non-absorbable sutures, on the other hand, are made from materials that do not degrade and require manual removal after the healing process. These sutures are preferred in cases where long-term support or wound closure is necessary.</p></p>
