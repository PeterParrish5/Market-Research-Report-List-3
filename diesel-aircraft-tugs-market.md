<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Diesel Aircraft Tugs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Conventional Tractors</li><li>Towbarless Tractors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Conventional tractors in the diesel aircraft tugs market are designed with a towbar attachment to connect and tow aircraft. These tractors require a towbar for each type of aircraft, making them less versatile and requiring more time for attachment. On the other hand, towbarless tractors in the market do not require a towbar for towing aircraft. They use arms or lifting mechanisms to securely lift and tow aircraft, offering more flexibility and efficiency in operations.</p></p>
