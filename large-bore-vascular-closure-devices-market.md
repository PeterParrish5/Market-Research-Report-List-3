<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Large Bore Vascular Closure Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive Closure Devices</li><li>Active Closure Devices</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Large Bore Vascular Closure Devices market is segmented into two main types: passive closure devices and active closure devices. Passive closure devices are designed to provide hemostasis (preventing bleeding) by using a mechanical seal or a plug made of collagen or other materials. Active closure devices, on the other hand, use a combination of mechanical and suture-based methods to close the vascular access site. Both types of closure devices are used to achieve efficient and safe closure of large bore vascular access sites following procedures such as transcatheter aortic valve replacement or endovascular aneurysm repair.</p></p>
