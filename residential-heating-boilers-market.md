<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Residential Heating Boilers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-condensing Boilers</li><li>Condensing Boilers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Residential heating boilers market can be divided into two main types - non-condensing boilers and condensing boilers. Non-condensing boilers operate by releasing exhaust gases through a chimney, while condensing boilers are more efficient as they capture and re-use heat that would otherwise be lost. Condensing boilers are becoming more popular due to their higher energy efficiency and lower emissions. Non-condensing boilers, on the other hand, are usually cheaper upfront but have higher operating costs in the long run.</p></p>
