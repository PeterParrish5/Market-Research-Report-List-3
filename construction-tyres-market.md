<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Construction Tyres Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bias Ply</li><li>Radial Ply</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Construction tyres are categorized into two main types: Bias Ply and Radial Ply. Bias Ply tyres are constructed with crisscrossed layers of cords, providing better load-carrying capacity and toughness. They are generally more affordable but may offer a rougher ride. On the other hand, Radial Ply tyres have cords laid at 90-degree angles to the direction of travel, resulting in better traction, fuel efficiency, and overall performance. While they are typically more expensive, they provide a smoother and more comfortable ride.</p></p>
