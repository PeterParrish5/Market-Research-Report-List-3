<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rotor Spinning Machinery Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-venting Type</li><li>Pumping Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Rotor spinning machinery market can be categorized into self-venting type and pumping type. Self-venting type machines have a venting system that removes air from the spinning rotor, improving spinning performance. On the other hand, pumping type machines use a pumping system to remove air from the spinning rotor. Both types aim to optimize spinning efficiency by ensuring there is no air interference during the spinning process. Customers can choose between these two types based on their specific needs and preferences.</p></p>
