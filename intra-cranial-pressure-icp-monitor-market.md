<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intra-cranial pressure (ICP) monitor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive</li><li>Non-Invasive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Intra-cranial pressure (ICP) monitors are devices used to measure the pressure inside the skull. There are two main types of ICP monitors: invasive and non-invasive. Invasive monitors are placed directly inside the skull through a hole made in the skull, providing the most accurate and direct measurement of ICP. Non-invasive monitors, on the other hand, measure ICP through external means such as ultrasounds or MRI technology, without the need for invasive procedures. Both types of monitors play a crucial role in managing conditions affecting intracranial pressure.</p></p>
