<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Motorcycle Braking System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Disc brake</li><li>Drum brake</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The motorcycle braking system market consists of two main types: disc brake and drum brake. Disc brakes are widely used in modern motorcycles due to their superior stopping power and heat dissipation capabilities. They work by squeezing brake pads against a metal rotor attached to the wheel. Drum brakes, on the other hand, use brake shoes that press against the inside of a drum attached to the wheel. While drum brakes are less efficient at dissipating heat, they are still commonly found on older or lower-end motorcycles.</p></p>
