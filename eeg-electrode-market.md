<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The EEG Electrode Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Repeatable EEG Electrode</li><li>Disposable EEG Electrode</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Repeatable EEG electrodes are designed for multiple uses, allowing for long-term monitoring of brain activity. These electrodes are typically made of high-quality materials that ensure reliable and consistent signal transmission. On the other hand, disposable EEG electrodes are intended for single-use applications, reducing the risk of cross-contamination and the need for cleaning or maintenance. Despite being more cost-effective, disposable electrodes may have a slightly lower signal quality compared to repeatable electrodes. Both types are essential tools in EEG monitoring and research.</p></p>
